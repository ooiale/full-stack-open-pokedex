# CI/CD Pipeline Process

In this chapter, we explored the CI/CD pipeline process, a crucial step in developing and maintaining applications. The CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline consists of a series of automated steps to check the integrity of the code and any future code that will be merged into the main branch of the application. This process facilitates collaboration in development teams and helps maintain the main application with minimal bugs.
