Continuous Integration (CI) is a set of processes that assists in ensuring the
application remains stable and functional throughout the development process.
Some of the processes include Linting, Testing, Building.
In python, some tools to assist in these steps are:
Pylint - analyzes the code for syntax errors, coding style violations... (Linting)
Pytest - provides a way to write and run tests for the code such as unit tests. (Testing)
Setuptools - Tool used for creating distributable packages eg: pip packages (Building)
Pyinstaller - Tool that can bundle the application into an executables (Building)

There are many hosting tools to set up the CI such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, AzureDevOps, GitLabCI...

In order to choose which hosting service to use for the CI, one need to consider many factors
A cloud based environment such as GitHubActions offers ease of setup, scalability and reduced
maintenance which is ideal for small-medium teams.
while a self-hosted service provides a greater control over the build environment which can make
setting it up harder, but in a larger-scale team it can come in handy not to mention that it can
be more cost efficient in this case.

In this example given, a cloud based environment looks advisable.
Their project should be released soon so the ease in setting up the cloud environment will be
quite helpful not to mention that the team is of small size so the scalability and cost efficiency should be better in this enviroment
